# Expense Tracker App

## App Overview
A modern Android expense tracking application built with Jetpack Compose that helps users monitor their daily expenses, categorize spending, and visualize financial trends through interactive charts and analytics.

## AI Usage Summary
I extensively used Claude AI and GitHub Copilot throughout the development process. Claude helped with architectural decisions, MVVM pattern implementation, Room database schema design, and Jetpack Compose UI components. Copilot assisted with code completion, boilerplate generation for ViewModels, Repository patterns, and data class definitions. I also used ChatGPT for debugging complex state management issues and optimizing database queries for better performance.

## Prompt Logs

### Key Prompts Used:

**Architecture & Setup:**
